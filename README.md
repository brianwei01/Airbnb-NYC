## **The Data**
The datasets were sourced from the [Inside Airbnb website](https://insideairbnb.com/), which provides detailed information on Airbnb listings in cities worldwide. This data includes a wide range of attributes such as listing IDs, host details, neighborhood locations, room types, pricing, availability, and more. The data is regularly updated and offers a comprehensive view of Airbnb activity across the cityâ€™s five boroughs, making it an ideal source for analyzing trends in the Airbnb market.

## **Analysis**
The analysis involved several steps, starting with a thorough exploration of the data using SQL queries in PostgreSQL's pgAdmin 4 to understand the structure, check for missing values, and calculate basic statistics. This was followed by more detailed analyses to uncover trends in pricing, room types, and neighborhood activity. Key insights were then visualized in Tableau, with dashboards showcasing individual listings on a map of New York City, and neighborhood-level trends in pricing and availability.
